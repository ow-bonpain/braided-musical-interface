The braided musical interface project is a wearable musical interface in the form of a fabric “braid” with multiple strands, 
each with sewn-in capacitive touch sensors connect to Arduino that trigger an audio of a simple note or audio sequence when touched by the user. 
As the strands of the fabric are braided together, the strands and touch sensors overlap at certain intervals, resulting in 
certain combinations of sound–for example, chords or notes that sound for the duration of two strands meeting at a certain juncture, 
depending on how the input connections are linked. In this way, each unique pattern of braiding results in a unique arrangement of music, 
tied to the duration and place of touch, the type of braiding pattern, and subtle differences in tension that impact where strands overlap.
